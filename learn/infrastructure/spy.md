# Spy

## Introduction

In the Wormhole context, a _Spy_ is a daemon that subscribes to the gossiped messages in the Guardian Network.

They donâ€™t do any validation work. Instead, they watch the Guardian Network and act as an interface to allow users and applications to check on the Spy-accessible messages.

## Spy-Accessible Messages

The messages available over gossip are things like:

- [Verifiable Action Approvals (VAAs)](/learn/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank} - packets of cross-chain data. A Spy can see whether a VAA has been approved by the Guardian Network
- [Observations](/learn/glossary/#observation){target=\_blank} - messages emitted by Core Contracts that the Guardians have picked up
- [Guardian heartbeats](/learn/glossary/#heartbeat){target=\_blank} - the liveness of a Guardian

## Source Code

The source code for the Spy is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/node/cmd/spy/spy.go){target=\_blank}.

## Example: Building a Simple Spy

To create a basic Spy that listens for a specific type of VAA, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Spy**: Use the existing Spy daemon to subscribe to all messages on the Guardian Network.
2. **Filter Messages**: Implement filtering logic to listen only for VAAs from specific emitters or with specific payloads.
3. **Process VAAs**: Once a relevant VAA is detected, process it by either logging the information or triggering further actions.

For example, you could build a Spy that listens for token transfer VAAs and triggers a notification or an automated process when a transfer exceeds a certain value.

## Enhancements for Developer Experience

- **Detailed examples**: Provide more code examples of different Spy implementations, such as filtering based on specific VAA fields or integrating with external services like Slack for alerts.
- **Monitoring and logging best practices**: Include tips on how to efficiently log and monitor Spy activity, especially when dealing with a high volume of messages.
- **Security considerations**: Add a section on securing your Spy setup, such as using access controls and monitoring to ensure the integrity of the messages being processed.
